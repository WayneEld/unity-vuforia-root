# unity-vuforia-root
An AR Unity application with Vuforia to call the Root Insurance API. 

A card object tracking AR app that uses an AR hub/plane to get quotes (via the Root insurance API) on specific AR objects that collide with the AR mesh quote plane.

I.e if you want to get an insurance quote on an IPhone 6s collide the corresponding AR object with the AR insuance quote plane.

The object will then display a 3D text premium price after the response from the Root Insurance API as an insurance quote.
